# Expert-Python-Programming_CRUD-project

This project consists of a Flask-based REST API utilizing a MySQL database for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on fund records. It's complemented by a JavaScript-based frontend for displaying, editing, and adding fund data.

Technologies Used:
Flask: Python web framework used for the backend API development.
MySQL: Relational database used for storing fund-related data.
JavaScript: Utilized for the frontend functionality and interaction with the Flask API.
Bootstrap: CSS framework for basic styling of HTML elements.

Flask Backend (data.py): Contains Flask routes for CRUD operations on the fund database.
JavaScript Frontend (index.html, edit.html, add.html, script.js): Provides a simple UI for interacting with the Flask API endpoints.
HTML Templates: Used for rendering frontend views (listing, add, edit).

Ensure MySQL is installed and configure the database connection in data.py.
Start the Flask API by running python python.py.
Access the frontend through a web browser.
